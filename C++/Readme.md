# Programs in C++ Programming Language 

C++ is a general-purpose object-oriented programming (OOP) language, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, and is an extension of the C language.
It is therefore possible to code C++ in a "C style" or "object-oriented style." In certain scenarios, it can be coded in either way and 
is thus an effective example of a hybrid language. This repository consists of the various C++ Programs and Code Snippets that have been 
coded in C++ Programming Language. The following programs has been implemented in the C++ Programming Language: 

- Implementing Stack Data Structure 
- Implementing Radix Sort Algorithm 
- Implement Dijkstra Algorithm
- Implement Quicksort Sorting Algorithm
- Implement Triply Linked List
- Implement singly linked list
